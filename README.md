Game Cube

We developed a Python-based gaming console named «The Game Cube» that serves as a source of entertainment for students and friends. The gaming console is an interactive application that integrates the games Hangman, Higher or Lower, and Tic Tac Toe. The Game Cube is developed with single players as well as multi-players in mind, allowing for a shared experience. This is supported by a dynamic leaderboard, which tracks the scores and the achievements across the different games played. 

Upon launching the Game Cube, the user is free to choose one of the games mentioned. The Hangman game creates a challenge for the user, who must guess a word that is suggested by missing letters. The number of guesses is limited, and the player needs to find the correct word within this limit. The Higher or Lower game is a card prediction game, where players can guess whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current card displayed. In this game, the player must be correct 8 consecutive times to win the game. And lastly, the Tic Tac Toe game, which is played by two users, encourages the strategic placement of X’s and O’s to form a line on a 3x3 grid. 

Some key features of the Game Cube include the integration of an external API, which is used in the Hangman game for the generation of random words, as well as the registration of usernames, the depiction of a dynamic leaderboard to highlight top players and their win-loss records. Additionally, the code showcases best practices in Python programming, including function definition, loop control, and user input validation. The goal was to familiarize ourselves with the fundamental concepts in Python programming and software development, ultimately serving us as a key learning tool to deepen our knowledge of the Python language.
